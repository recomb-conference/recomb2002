<b>About the award:</b><br>
   The Award is named in honor of Dr. Fred Howes who, as the 
   Program Director of the US Department of Energy, MICS Applied 
   Mathematics Program in 1979 provided tremendous support towards the
   founding of the International Annual RECOMB Conference Series.
   In addition to RECOMB, his visionary reach extended to a variety of
   other DOE-funded enterprises in support of computational biology. The
   DOE Applied Mathematics Program was founded at DOE by John von Neumann.
   Dr. Howes led this program for over 14 years until his untimely death
   in 1999.  It was the strongest applied mathematics program in the
   United States and included support for research groups in many DOE
   National Laboratories, as well as a large number of universities.  We
   honor with this award a visionary mathematician of unusual modesty who
   distinguished himself through the exceptional service that he provided
   for the applied mathematics community in general and computational
   biology in particular.  For many of us, especially the young
   researchers, he was a friend, a mentor, and a force for good.
